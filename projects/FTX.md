FTX and Alameda Research created the Serum Foundation and announced Serum, a new high-speed, non-custodial DEX that’s built on Solana. You can learn more about Serum in the white paper and in this comprehensive write-up on The Block.

Serum is a complete, non-custodial spot and derivatives exchange running on an on-chain central limit order book (CLOB) on Solana’s mainnet. Yep, you read that right.

In order to maximize access to Serum, Serum will support cross-chain asset swaps, decentralized stablecoins, decentralized oracles, and non-custodial wrapped BTC, BCH, BSV, LTC, ZEC, ETH, and ERC-20s. Serum will decentralize the entire DeFi stack. Nothing will be left centralized.
