Magic has developed an SDK that allows users to access decentralised applications with a phone number or email address, all without the need for a browser extension. Allowing developers to capture a market of users that haven’t been onboarded into existing wallet providers. It’s as simple as adding 3 code snippets to any existing web3 applications. They are currently integrated into over 20 other applications, including Set Protocol and Uniswap.
