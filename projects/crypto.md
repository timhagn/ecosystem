On August 6th, 2020, Crypto.com did a surprise listing of SOL due to heavy demand from their community.

With SOL added to the Crypto.com App, users can now purchase it at true cost with no fees - credit card and bank transfer both supported.

As Crypto.com also offers a Visa Card, this adds additional utility to SOL as users can easily convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and spend at over 60m merchants globally.
