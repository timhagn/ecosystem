The Graph, the indexing and query layer of the decentralized web, revealed that Solana would be one of the additional Layer 1 blockchains to soon be supported by the protocol. Solana will be joining The Graphâ€™s current support for Ethereum and IPFS. This expansion is opening Web3 opportunities to a wider ecosystem of builders and users.

The Graph's indexing of L1s allows developers to access multi-chain data without the need to maintain their own indexers. These decentralized API feeds will make it easier for dapps on Solana to act on cross-chain events, and query historic chain data with a high degree of confidence in the authenticity of that information.

This announcement is part of an ongoing expansion of bi-directional interoperability between Solana and other L1 and L2 protocols, building on the success of toolsets like Wormhole.
