Bonfida aims to be the single source of truth in the cryptocurrency industry. This covers categories including (but not limited to) exchange statistics and crypto company reviews and scoring, whilst also providing explanations and in-depth research on crypto trends and notable occurrences.

Bonfida will also handle an array of data aggregation and visualisation, which has proved popular amongst crypto traders who donâ€™t typically have the means to parse this data themselves.
