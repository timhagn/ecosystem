Oxygen.org is a DeFi Prime Brokerage Protocol built for the future to support 100s of millions of people. It can help you, as a holder of digital assets, generate liquidity, earn yield, borrow assets to go short, get trading leverage against portfolio of assets. It allows for a more efficient use of your assets in 3 key ways:

1. Multiple use of the same collateral. Oxygen enables you to generate yield on your portfolio through lending out your assets and borrowing other assets at the same time.
2. Cross-collateralisation. With Oxygen, you can utilise all of your portfolio as collateral, when you want to borrow other assets. This should mean lower margin call/liquidation risk for your portfolio.
3. Market-based pricing. Oxygen protocol is order-book based, rather than following a pre-set market model that needs to be manually adjusted. This means you get the best/fair price for borrowing/lending every time.
