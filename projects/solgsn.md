SolGSN is a gas station implementation for Solana. The platform allows users to do fee-less transactions, where the dApp creator pays fees on behalf of the user. This gives dApp creators more flexibility to provide a more seamless user experience. Also, the dApp and user can add or withdraw credits at any time.
