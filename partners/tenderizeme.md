Tenderize.me is a non-custodial liquid staking solution, focused on yield maximisation and ease of use while keeping staking decentralized! We provide users with tenderSol, a value accruing staking derivative token, which allows them to enter or exit staking with no bonding and unbonding period! Our main focus is to make staking more efficient and easy for regular non-technical Solana community members. Having a tenderSol token that represents their staking position allows users to use it again, for example as a collateral in other protocols. Donâ€™t just ðŸ¥©stake me, ðŸ”¨Tenderize.me first!
