The DeFi Passport is an extension that allows you to sync all your on-chain transaction histories across blockchains in a verifiable manner. Such transaction histories can include trading data, liquidity providing, governance participation, NFT creation, and many others. It operates using on-chain information to build a base identity. You can then use your transaction history to demonstrate who you are to anyone both on-chain or off-chain.
